## Linux/MacOS

> venv (virtual environment) is only for your own convinience

# What does it do?
It creates PGM files of generated noises, that can be later translated into PNG format via external tool like ImageMagick.
For this tool, there is also `parse.sh/.cmd`, which makes it easier for parsing all images.
